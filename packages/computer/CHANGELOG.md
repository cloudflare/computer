### Minor Changes

- [#41](https://github.com/cloudflare/computer/pull/41) [`a753db7`](https://github.com/cloudflare/computer/commit/a753db7ead38a3028939a87ee9dc087da38d9928) Thanks [@aron-cf](https://github.com/aron-cf)! - Heavy worker-shell commands are now opt-in to reduce the final bundle size.

### Patch Changes

- [#87](https://github.com/cloudflare/computer/pull/87) [`8758b51`](https://github.com/cloudflare/computer/commit/8758b51c8891c211dddd1903d2ee2d12a75ac7ff) Thanks [@aron-cf](https://github.com/aron-cf)! - Cut peak memory during a sync pull. Applying a file entry now links the chunks the sender already staged instead of reading them back and joining them into one whole-file buffer, which used to hold roughly twice the file size in the isolate at once.
